# ☀️ Weather App

To find out what the weather is like where you are right now or in other places, use the Weather app. Find any city or add it to your list of "favorite cities." Each city's name and current temperature will be included, along with how it feels, what the wind is like, humidity and a picture of the clouds.

## 📖 Description

For this project, which is Single Page Application, I have two separate repositories: one for the frontend and one for the backend.
I used React-Router to establish three client-side routes, json-server to create a RESTful API for my backend, and performed GET and POST requests to the json server. As a stretch goal, I incorporated data from an external API, incorporated a DELETE request, and the Material UI framework, as well as creating CSS files.
